#### Problem

We are looking to add some new content to our [Space theme](https://new.americanreading.com/themes/space) for ARC Core. Our curriculum and instruction team would love to see some data about rockets. ðŸš€

#### Task

Use the SpaceX API to display the last 50 launches and some info about each one.

-   Rocket
    -   name
    -   weight(lb)
    -   cost per launch
-   Launch Site
-   Launch Date
-   Mission Name
-   Flight Number
-   Details

##### Things to think about:

-   How can you make the data interactive?
-   Is the UI consistent and user-friendly?
-   Is the intention/function of the page readily apparent to the user?
-   Does the page look good on all devices?

You can find the docs for the API here: [https://docs.spacexdata.com/](https://docs.spacexdata.com/)

You can use any tools you wish to complete this assessment. Feel free to use the internet to look for resources!
